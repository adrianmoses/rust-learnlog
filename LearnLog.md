Today we will normalize a dataset with polars

Also will setup using scrapingbee or zenrows to test scraping
Another step would be to use webdriver or chrome headless to scrape

Actually here are the steps
- simple scraping with reqwet
- scrping with chrome headless
- scraping with scrapingbee or zenrows


Was able to call min max on columns but polars appears to have a bug with arrow

Was able to scrape with reqwest and scraper and works pretty well. Not difficult at all

Need to review rust and relearn about unwrap because it still seems like code smell

Also want to look into https://docs.rs/thirtyfour/latest/thirtyfour/

Today I want to set up this repo and begin with two main use cases I have for Rust: Webscraping and ML

A third use case is with services but I will start with a CLI to run these

For ML I will also add an ebook based around python for writing ML algorithms from scratch

For webscraping I will start with reqwest and chrome-headless to read the contents of any page

Was able to set up a script to read a csv with polars
