Today I want to set up this repo and begin with two main use cases I have for Rust: Webscraping and ML

A third use case is with services but I will start with a CLI to run these

For ML I will also add an ebook based around python for writing ML algorithms from scratch

For webscraping I will start with reqwest and chrome-headless to read the contents of any page

Was able to set up a script to read a csv with polars
